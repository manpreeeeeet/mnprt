            Hi, I am manpreet. I write code to make computers do stuff.

        <h2>Computers</h2>
        <p>
            I spend majority of my time writing and reading code and I believe in caring for the software I write.
            There's always something new to discover and learn which makes this field a whole lot more interesting for me.
        </p>
        <p>
            I do not think of myself as an X programmer. I write and learn whatever is required to solve the problem 
            at hand which could involve learning a new language, staring at variables at a breakpoint, reading stack traces, 
            query plans, library code or telling claude that he's wrong.
        </p>
        <h2>Media</h2>
        <p>
            I love watching movies and tv-shows, my favorite ones are mainly anime styled.
            I recommend watching <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt22248376/">Frieren</a> to anyone would listen.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have picked up reading and have been really enjoying it. I do not have much to recommend but I did enjoy
            "Letters to Kafka" a lot.
        </p>
        <h2>Other stuff</h2>
        <p>
            I have also started to collect stationery. My
            current collection includes:
            <ul>
                <li>rOtring 600</li>
                <li>Pilot Kakuno</li>
                <li>Midori MD A5z</li>
            </ul>
